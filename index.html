    <h2>French Onion Soup</h2>

    <p>We have been trying <strong>French onion soup</strong> in restaurants for years, and my family and friends agree — <i>none can compare to my recipe for <strong>taste</strong> and <strong>simplicity</strong> of preparation.</i></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cups sliced onions</li>
      <li>5 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 slices French bread</li>
      <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
      <li>2 slices Swiss cheese, diced</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.</li>
      <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
      <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Photos of Portuguese Steamed Clams</h2>
    <p>Being of Portuguese descent and raised in Rhode Island along the Eastern seaboard, this recipe for <strong>Portuguese clams</strong> is a wonderful combination of my two heritages. If desired serve with a small cup of melted butter for dipping the clams in and don't forget a fresh loaf of warm, crusty bread! 
      <br><i>Note: If the clams seem sandy, soak them for a couple of hours or overnight in the refrigerator in salted water with a bit of <strong>vinegar</strong>, <strong>cornmeal</strong>, and <strong>cayenne pepper</strong>.</i></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds clams in shell, scrubbed</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds chorizo, sliced into chunks</li>
      <li>1 large onion, cut into thin wedges</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cups white wine</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash clams well in a sink of cold water. Discard any clams that are already opened.</li>
      <li>In a large stockpot with a tightly fitting lid, place the cleaned clams. Add sausage, onion, tomatoes, and wine. Cover and set over high heat. Steam until all clams open up. Be sure to shake the pot often to insure even heat.</li>
      <li>Drizzle olive oil over cooked clams. Evenly divide all the ingredients among warm soup plates. Divide the broth among side cups for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
